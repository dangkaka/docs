| Data link | Frame | Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer |
| Network | Packet | Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control |
| Transport | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) | Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing |
| Session | Data | Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes |
| Presentation | Data | Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption |
